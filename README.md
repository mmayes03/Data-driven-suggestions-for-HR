# Data-driven-suggestions-for-HR
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. Provide data-driven suggestions based on the understanding of the data. This is the main question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

The goal is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. 

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
